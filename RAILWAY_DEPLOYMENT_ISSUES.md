# üö® Railway Deployment Issues - Bot Works Locally

## üîç **Common Railway Issues When Bot Works Locally:**

### **1. ‚ùå Service Type Problem**
**Issue**: Railway is treating your bot as a **Web Service** instead of **Background Worker**
**Solution**: 
- Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Settings
- Change **Service Type** from "Web Service" to "Background Worker"
- Or ignore PORT warnings if using Web Service

### **2. ‚ùå Session File Issues**
**Issue**: Railway can't create `.session` files properly
**Solution**: 
- Railway needs write permissions for session files
- Use `workdir="."` in Pyrogram client
- Let Pyrogram create new session on Railway

### **3. ‚ùå Environment Variables**
**Issue**: Environment variables not properly set
**Solution**:
- Check Railway dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Variables
- Verify: BOT_TOKEN, API_ID, API_HASH
- Make sure API_ID is integer, not string

### **4. ‚ùå Network/Connection Issues**
**Issue**: Railway's network environment causes disconnections
**Solution**:
- Use Railway-optimized Pyrogram settings
- Add connection retry logic
- Use proper sleep_threshold

### **5. ‚ùå Resource Limits**
**Issue**: Free tier limitations
**Solution**:
- Check Railway usage dashboard
- Monitor $5 credit limit
- Optimize bot for minimal resource usage

## üîß **Quick Fixes:**

### **Fix 1: Change Service Type**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Change "Service Type" to "Background Worker"
5. Save and redeploy

### **Fix 2: Check Environment Variables**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Variables"
3. Verify these are set:
   ```
   BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   API_ID=12345678
   API_HASH=your_api_hash_here
   ```

### **Fix 3: Use Railway-Optimized Code**
Use the Railway-optimized version that handles Railway's environment better.

### **Fix 4: Check Logs**
1. Go to Railway dashboard

## üéØ **Most Common Solutions:**

1. **Change to Background Worker** (if possible)
2. **Check environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Use Railway-optimized Pyrogram settings**
4. **Monitor Railway usage** (free tier limits)

## üöÄ **If Still Not Working:**

The issue is likely one of these:
- **Service Type**: Wrong deployment type
- **Environment**: Variables not set properly
- **Network**: Railway's network environment
- **Resources**: Free tier limitations

**The bot code is fine - it's a Railway deployment configuration issue!**
