# üöÄ Railway Deployment Guide (Working Version)

This guide will help you deploy the KITS Bot to Railway using the **original working methods** that you see in the screenshot.

## ‚úÖ What This Deployment Includes

- **Original working methods** (same as your local bot)

- **All features working** exactly like your local version
- **Attendance, Bunk, Biometric, Marks, etc.**

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Railway
```bash
railway login
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Bot
```bash
python deploy_railway_working.py
```

## üîß Manual Deployment

If the script doesn't work, follow these manual steps:

### 1. Initialize Railway Project
```bash
railway init
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
```bash
railway variables set BOT_TOKEN=8007204996:AAGbfj4e6sEefgdI8Ixncl3tVoI6kKnZo28
railway variables set API_ID=27523374
railway variables set API_HASH=b7a72638255400c7107abd58b1f79711
railway variables set SUPABASE_URL=https://wecaohxjejimxhbcgmjp.supabase.co
railway variables set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6IndlY2FvaHhqZWppbXhoYmNnbWpwIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTkyMjk1NzQsImV4cCI6MjA3NDgwNTU3NH0.MPOSqIjbPLd1zoqwjsCZQBQSeUBMQdRND7lnMOmbCfk
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:Viggu@2006@db.wecaohxjejimxhbcgmjp.supabase.co:5432/postgres
railway variables set PGHOST=db.wecaohxjejimxhbcgmjp.supabase.co

railway variables set PGDATABASE=postgres
railway variables set PGUSER=postgres
railway variables set PGPASSWORD=Viggu@2006
railway variables set FORCE_SUPABASE_REST=true
railway variables set DISABLE_SQLITE_FALLBACK=true

railway up
```

## üìã Files Used

- `main_railway_working.py` - Main bot file with working methods
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- `Procfile` - Process definition
- `deploy_railway_working.py` - Automated deployment script

## üéØ Expected Result

After deployment, your bot will work **exactly** like the screenshot you showed:

1. Check if bot is running: `railway status`
2. Restart the service: `railway restart`
3. Check logs for errors

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Railway dashboard
2. Look at the deployment logs
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
